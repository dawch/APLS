This will produce a transient improvement beginning within minutes and lasting for up to 2 hours. It may need to be repeated, and if so, additional measures should be taken to ensure the airway is managed by senior staff.</div><div>• Children who require adrenaline for the emergency treatment of croup should also receive nebulised or oral steroids, such as oral dexamethasone 150micrograms/kg (see below).</div><div>• Adrenaline reduces the clinical severity of obstruction, but does not improve arterial blood gases, reduce the duration of hospitalisation or eliminate the need for intubation. Children who have received adrenaline will appear improved for a short while only and need to be observed very closely with continuous ECG and oxygen saturation monitoring. They may later require tracheal intubation. A marked tachycardia is usually produced by the adrenaline, but other side effects are uncommon. This treatment is best used to ‘buy time’ in which to assemble an experienced team to treat a child with severe croup.</div><div>• Give humidified oxygen through a face mask, and monitor the oxygen saturation. Many children admitted to hospital with croup have hypoxia as a result of alveolar hypoventilation secondary to airways obstruction and ventilation perfusion imbalance. Whilst the respiratory rate and the degree of sternal recession are valuable clinical indicators of severity and response to treatment, the degree of hypoxia is the best assessment. However, hypoventila- tion may be masked when the child is receiving high ambient oxygen. The oxygen saturation with the child breathing air should be checked intermittently.</div><div>• Inhalation of warm moist air is widely used but is of unproven benefit.</div></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>"
